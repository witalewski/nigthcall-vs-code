## Features

## Requirements
> As of version 1.0.5 Nightcall only supports macOS!

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `nightcall.nightTheme`: color theme to use at night

## Origin
This extension has been inspired by [NightSwitch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gharveymn.nightswitch). In comparison with NightSwitch, Nightcall (VS Code) utilizes an external application to schedule changing theme so it can be synchronized with system theme and other applications. Also, Nightcall uses location of WiFi towers by default to provide greater accuracy and avoid false results when behind a proxy or VPN.
